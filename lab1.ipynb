This practical approach will showcase how to run modern generative AI workloads effectively on Arm hardware while minimizing latency and memory usage.\n",

    "### **Why Arm Vector Instructions?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Arm processors are ubiquitous in modern computing, powering everything from smartphones to edge devices and increasingly, servers and supercomputers. Their architecture is designed for energy efficiency and performance, making them ideal for deploying AI models in diverse environments. One of the key features that enable Arm processors to excel in AI workloads is their support for **vector instructions**, such as Neon and i8mm, which allow for parallel processing of multiple data points in a single instruction cycle. Armv8-A is a member of the Arm architecture family, representing the 8th generation of Arm's advanced architecture with a focus on 64-bit computing, high performance, and scalable designs. It builds upon the energy-efficient foundation of earlier Arm architectures while introducing advanced features such as support for AArch64 (the 64-bit instruction set), enhanced vector processing capabilities, and improved cryptographic extensions. Armv8-A is widely adopted in a range of mobile and embedded devices, including the **Raspberry Pi 4 and 5**.\n",

    "### 3. **Neon Vectorization (Integer8-based)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation leverages Neon SIMD instructions for efficient integer matrix multiplication. While it does **not** utilize i8mm-specific instructions or other advanced Arm intrinsics, it achieves high performance with quantized data using the following Neon operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Neon Instructions Observed:\n",
    "   - **`movi` (Move Immediate):** initializes all elements of a Neon vector register to a specified immediate value, such as zero;\n",
    "   - **`smlal` (Signed Multiply-Add Long):** multiplies pairs of 8-bit integers from two vector registers, producing 16-bit results, and accumulates them into a 16-bit vector register;\n",
    "   - **`addv` (Add Across Vector):** horizontally sums all elements of a Neon vector register into a single scalar value; and\n",
    "   - **`smov` (Scalar Move):** moves the lowest element from a Neon vector register into a scalar general-purpose register.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Characteristics:\n",
    "   - processes **8 `int8_t` elements at a time** due to Neon's 128-bit vector registers, allowing for significantly higher throughput compared to `float32` implementations;\n",
    "   - accumulates intermediate results in 16-bit registers (`int16`) to avoid overflow during the computation; and\n",
    "   - reduces the final 16-bit vector to a scalar using a horizontal sum (`addv`) followed by moving the scalar value to a general-purpose register (`smov`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Observations:\n",
    "   - **Performance Benefits**:\n",
    "     - processes multiple `int8` elements per instruction, maximizing the benefits of vectorization; and\n",
    "     - smaller data types (`int8` vs. `float32`) reduce memory bandwidth requirements and improve efficiency.\n",
    "   - **Precision Limitations**:\n",
    "     - integer arithmetic lacks the precision of floating-point operations, making it best suited for quantized workloads like neural network inference where reduced precision is acceptable.\n",
    "   - **Applications**:\n",
    "     - ideal for embedded systems, mobile devices, and other environments requiring low-power, memory-efficient AI inference.\n",

    "***NOTE***  \n",
    "If the code block below does not show the exact instructions described above, you can open the `bin/int8_neon.s` file to view the assembly.

The SIMD floating-point implementation offers significant speedup, but the SIMD integer implementation is the fastest as it's the int8 lower bit-width allows a higher degree of parallelism. This highlights the advantage of using lower-precision operations in AI network forward passes for improved performance."

    "Having explored how Arm's SIMD capabilities in C can accelerate AI workloads, we now transition to PyTorch which is a versatile, high-level framework that balances flexibility and ease of use. PyTorch streamlines AI model development by abstracting low-level operations, enabling developers to focus on model architecture and experimentation rather than intricate implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the manual coding required for SIMD operations in C, PyTorch offers built-in support for tensor computations and hardware acceleration. It automatically utilizes processor optimizations, including SIMD and Arm's Neon instructions, to enhance performance without requiring developers to write low-level code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section, we will examine how PyTorch utilizes the Armv8-A's vectorization capability and benchmark Python-based matrix multiplication using both `int8` and `fp32` precision. Building on this foundation, we will implement and optimize the inference of a state-of-the-art small language model, **OpenELM**, showcasing PyTorch's powerful capabilities for handling advanced AI workloads on Armv8.\n",

    "You should be able to see that for small matrices, there is little difference in latency for processing floating-point and integer linear layers. As the matrix size increases, the integer linear layer latency should increase slower than floating point. Therefore if we can quantize linear layers, used by generative AI models from floating-point to integer values without losing too much accuracy, we can see a significant latency improvement (not to mention reduced memory consumption)."

    "OpenELM is a recently released, small open-source language model by Apple, designed for efficient local deployment [(OpenELM Paper)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14619). It comes in compact sizes: 270M, 450M, 1.1B, and 3B, making it ideal for embedded applications. In this lab, we will use OpenELM-270M and focus on optimizing its inference speed on Arm devices.\n",

    "   Navigate to the [meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf) page on Hugging Face. You need to do this, as the OpenELM model uses the Lamma Tokenizer. \n",

    "\n",
    "In this section, we will begin by lowering the precision of the feedforward linear layers (heavily reliant on matrix multiplications) to the `int8` datatype. This process, known as **quantization**, can greatly improve performance. Specifically, we will explore a technique called **Integer Per-Tensor Symmetric Weight-Only Quantization**. A bit of a mouthful, but let’s break it down how it works. \n",

    "#### **Integer Per-Tensor Symmetric Weight-Only Quantization**\n",
    "\n",
    "Integer symmetric weight-only quantization reduces a neural network's weight precision from floating-point to integer values, while keeping activations in floating-point format during inference, hence why it is called weight-only. Although in this format, the underlying matrix multiplication still occurs in floating-point, for example via `torch.mm(W.dequantize(), x)`, weight-only quantization can decrease the model's static memory consumption by up to 4x. Additionally in cases where inference speed is limited by memory bandwidth, reducing the weight precision can also lower memory read latencies, further speeding up inference. Now lets go through some of the maths:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that the equation of the linear layer s is outlined below, where $X^{fp}$ is the input activation, $W^{fp}$ the floating-point weight matrix and $B^{fp}$ where the superscript $fp$ denotes that the input activation, weight, and bias are in floating point. \n",
    "\n",
    "$y = X^{fp}W^{fp} + B^{fp}$\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply Symmetric Per-Tensor weight-only quantization, the floating-point weights $W^{fp}$ are quantized to integer values $ W^{q} $ using a single scale factor $ S_w $ which is a floating-point value. This scalar maps the floating-point range of the weight, to integer range e.g. (-128, 127) for `int8`. It can be computed based on the maximum absolute weight value: where |W| is the absolute weight matrix and $b$ is the number of bits in the integer value, for `int8` it is 8. (Note: don't confuse the bias $B^{fp}$ with the number of bits $b$)\n",

When weights are quantized to `int8` $ W^q $ but activations remain in floating-point $X^{fp}$, a mismatch occurs. To resolve this, the quantized weights must be dequantized back into floating-point values before computation.\n",

    "### Integer Per-Tensor Symmetric Weight-Only Quantization\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at this plot, you can see that the larger channels exhibit broad distributions with large outliers, whereas the smaller channels display tight distributions centered around zero. If we were to apply per-tensor quantization, which uses a single scale value $ S_w $ computed as `W.abs().max() / (2**(b-1) - 1)`, the presence of outliers in the largest channel would disproportionately inflate the numerator. Since the denominator is fixed by the quantization bit-width $ b $, this results in an overly large scale factor. Consequently, the quantization process would lead to substantial rounding errors, thereby degrading the overall accuracy of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome this, we can use a technique called **Symmetric Per-Channel Weight-Only Quantization** where we increase the granularity of quantization from **Per-Tensor** to **Per-Channel**. Instead of using only a single scale factor for the entire tensor, we compute a separate scale factor for each output channel of the weight matrix (row of the matrix $W_fp$), thereby quantizing each seperately. This allows us to more accurately quantize the weights in each channel, reducing the quantization error, and preserving the accuracy of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process for doing this is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Channel-Wise Scale Factor\n",
    "For each channel $i$ of $\\mathbf{W}$ (i.e., row $\\mathbf{W}_i$), compute a channel-specific scale factor:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "S_{w_i} = \\frac{\\max(|\\mathbf{W}^{fp}_i|)}{2^{b-1} - 1}.\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Channel-Wise Quantization and Dequantization\n",
    "1. **Quantization**: Convert the weights of each output channel indexed by $i$ to integer values: \n",
    "\n",
    "   $\n",
    "   W^q_{w_i} = \\text{round}\\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{W}^{fp}_i}{S_{w_i}}\\right)\n",

    "# 5. Deployment of Language Models with `llama.cpp`\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we explore the `llama.cpp` framework, a lightweight and efficient inference solution written in pure C++, making it well-suited for deploying language models on Arm embedded devices while leveraging advanced hardware capabilities for acceleration. Known for its minimal dependencies and streamlined design, `llama.cpp` enables fast and resource-efficient execution, making it ideal for systems with limited computational power.\n",
    "\n",
    "One key distinction between `llama.cpp` and frameworks such as Hugging Face Transformers lies in their execution modes:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Eager Mode in Hugging Face Transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "Hugging Face's Transformer models typically operate using the PyTorch framework in *eager execution mode*. In this mode:\n",
    "- Each operation is executed immediately as it is encountered, allowing for dynamic and flexible control of the computation.\n",
    "- This approach is particularly user-friendly and facilitates debugging and experimentation, as developers can inspect intermediate results and modify computations on the fly.\n",
    "- However, the trade-off is lower efficiency for inference due to repeated overhead from interpreting and dispatching operations at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "While eager mode is advantageous during development and for flexible use cases, its runtime inefficiency becomes a bottleneck in deployment scenarios, particularly on resource-constrained devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graph Execution in `llama.cpp`\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, `llama.cpp` employs *graph execution*:\n",
    "- During model initialization, a computational graph is constructed, representing the sequence of operations required for inference.\n",
    "- This graph is optimized before execution, removing redundant computations, fusing operations, and leveraging hardware-specific optimizations such as vectorization or efficient memory layouts.\n",
    "- The entire graph is then executed as a single optimized unit, minimizing overhead, and maximizing throughput.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach significantly enhances inference efficiency, particularly on embedded systems where computational and memory resources are limited. By using a static execution model, `llama.cpp` avoids the runtime overhead of dynamic operation dispatch, enabling faster and more predictable performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following section, you will go through a workflow for deploying the OpenELM Hugging Face model with the `llama.cpp` inference framework. By transitioning from eager execution to optimized graph execution, this deployment achieves substantial performance gains, showcasing the practical advantages of `llama.cpp` for real-world applications.\n",
